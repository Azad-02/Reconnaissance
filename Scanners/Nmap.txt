1. Network Mapper (Nmap)

Popular tool used to carry out port scanning, discover network protocols, identify running services, and detect operating systems on live hosts. 

Nmap Scan Types
	TCP SCAN: -checks and completes a three-way handshake with Target System.
		  -generally very noisy and can be detected with almost little to no effort because the services can log the sender IP address 
		   and might trigger Intrusion Detection Systems.
	UDP SCAN: -checks whether there is any UDP port up and listening for incoming requests on the target machine.
		  -there is always a chance for a false positive in the scan results due to lack of acknowledgement.
		  -this scan reveals Trojan horses that might be running on UDP ports or even reveal hidden RPC services.
		  -tends to be quite slow
	SYN SCAN: -another form of TCP scan. 
		  -nmap itself crafts a syn packet, which is the first packet that is sent to establish a TCP connection.
		  -connection is never formed, rather the responses to these specially crafted packets are analyzed by Nmap to produce scan results.
	ACK SCAN: -determines whether a particular port is filtered or not.
		  -proves to be extremely helpful when trying to probe for firewalls and their existing set of rules.
		  -Simple packet filtering will allow established connections (packets with the ACK bit set), whereas a more sophisticated stateful 
		   firewall might not.
	FIN SCAN: -stealthy scan, like the SYN scan, but sends a TCP FIN packet instead.
		  -can show false positives and negatives because not all computers will send an RST packet (reset packet) back.
		  -might get under the radar of some IDS programs.
	NULL SCAN:-extremely stealthy scan
		  -sets all the header fields to null.
		  -when a system is not running windows this can be used as an effective way to get through.
	XMAS SCAN:-extremely stealthy scan
		  -Computers running windows will not respond to Xmas scans due to the way their TCP stack is implemented.
		  -used to manipulate the PSH, URG and FIN flags that can be found in the TCP header.
	RPC SCAN: -discover machines that responds to Remote Procedure Call services (RPC).
		  -allows commands to be run on a certain machine remotely, under a certain set of connections.
		  -it becomes hard to infer from a normal scan whether RPC services are running or not.
	IDLE SCAN:-stealthiest of all scans
		  -packets are bounced off an external host.
		  -mostly used for malicious attacks.

COMMON EXAMPLES OF NMAP

- For scanning a web application:
	> sudo nmap -sVC -p- -T4 --open -O <IP Address> -oN <filename>
	
	-sVC : Version scan + Script scan
	-p-  : Scan all ports
	-T4  : Aggressive speed scan for Quick results
	-O   : Detect OS
	-oN  : Normal output format into specified file


> nmap -iL list_of_hosts.txt		# provide a file as input for your list of targets
