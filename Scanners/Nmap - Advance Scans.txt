ADVANCE SCANS



1. nmap -sT IP_ADDR		# TCP Connect Scan

TCP 3-Way Handshake for TCP Connect Scan

		------------ SYN -------------->
CLIENT		<----------- SYN/ACK -----------		SERVER
		------------ ACK -------------->
		------------ RST/ACK ---------->

- A closed TCP port responds to a SYN packet with RST/ACK to indicate that it is not open.
- Open Ports reply with a SYN/ACK & Nmap completes the 3-way Handshake by sending an ACK.
- Firewall might log the handshake attempt by attacker since it tries to make complete Handshake.



2. nmap -sS IP_ADDR		# TCP SYN Scan

TCP 3-Way handshake for TCP SYN Scan

		------------- SYN ------------->
CLIENT		<---------- SYN/ACK ------------		SERVER
		------------- RST ------------->

- Requires Privileged user (root or sudoer)
- SYN scan does not complete the TCP 3-way handshake, instead, it blocks the connection once it receives a response (SYN/ACK) from the server.
- Nmap sends an RST packet once a SYN/ACK packet is received.
- It discovers the open ports successfully without fully establishing the TCP Connection.
- Firewall can't log the handshake attempt by attacker since it doesn't make complete Handshake.



3. nmap -sU IP_ADDR		# UDP Scan

UDP Scan

CLIENT		----------- UDP PCKT --------->			SERVER

- Requires root privileges.
- There is no gurantee that the service listening of UDP port will respond.
- Closed UDP Port will respond with unreachable error (type 3(Destination Unreachable), code 3(Port Unreachable)).
- Open ports won't respond back, thus Nmap will state them as Open.

PERFORMANCE & FINE TUNING OF NMAP SCANS



1. Specifying the ports

- port list: 			-p22,80,443
- port range: 			-p1-1023
- all 65535 ports: 		-p-
- most common 100 ports: 	-F	
- most common 10 ports:		--top-ports 10



2. Control Scan Timing

- scan timing			-T<0-5>

- paranoid			-T0 	# TO avoid IDS alerts. Scans one port, waits 5 mins to send next probe.
- sneaky 			-T1	# often used during real-world engagements for stealth scans. For avoiding Firewalls.
- polite 			-T2	# time-delay of 400 milleseconds. Unlikely to interfere with the target system.
- normal 			-T3	# default Nmap Scan.
- aggressive			-T4	# often used during CTFs & learning to scan practice targets.
- insane 			-T5	# Most aggressive. Might affect accuracy of scan results due to increased likelihood of packet loss.

- host timeout			--host-timeout 1m	# scan target for 1 minute before aborting
				--host-timeout 60s	



3. Control Packet Rate

- Don't send more than 10 packets per Second		--max-rate 10 OR --max-rate=10
- Send atleast 10 packets per second			--min-rate 10 OR --min-rate=10



4. Control Probing Parallelism

- Maintain atleast 512 probes in parallel		--min-parallelism 512 OR --min-parallelism=512
- Maintain probes not more than 512 in parallel		--max-parallelism 512 OR --max-parallelism=512
