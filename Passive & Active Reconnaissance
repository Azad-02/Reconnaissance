-> PASSIVE RECON

1. WHOIS : 
	WHOIS server listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests.
	The domain registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names it is leasing. 
> whois DOMAIN_NAME		


2. NSLOOKUP (Name Server Look Up) :
	Can find the IP address of a domain name.
> nslookup DOMAIN_NAME
> nslookup OPTIONS DOMAIN_NAME SERVER
	- OPTIONS contains the query type
	- DOMAIN_NAME is the website domain we are looking up
	- SERVER is the DNS server that you want to query

DNS SERVERS - LOCAL ISP's DNS Server
	    - Cloudflare - 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1
	    - Google - 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
	    - Quad9 - 9.9.9.9 and 149.112.112.112
QUERY TYPES - A		- IPv4 Addresses
	    - AAAA	- IPv6 Addresses
	    - CNAME	- Canonical Name
	    - MX	- Mail Servers
	    - SOA	- Start of Authority
	    - TXT	- TXT Records

> nslookup -type=A domain.com 1.1.1.1

For Eg.
> nslookup -type=MX domain.com 

Sample Output- 

domain.com	mail exchanger = 5 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.
domain.com	mail exchanger = 1 aspmx.l.google.com.
domain.com	mail exchanger = 10 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com.
domain.com	mail exchanger = 10 alt3.aspmx.l.google.com.
domain.com	mail exchanger = 5 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.

	- Since MX is looking up the Mail Exchange servers, when a mail server tries to deliver email @domain.com, it will try to connect to the 
	  aspmx.l.google.com, which has order 1. 
	- If it is busy or unavailable, the mail server will attempt to connect to the next in order mail exchange servers, alt1.aspmx.l.google.com 
	  or alt2.aspmx.l.google.com


3. DIG (Domain Information Groper) : 
	For more advanced DNS queries and additional functionality
> dig DOMAIN_NAME
> dig DOMAIN_NAME TYPE		# To specify record type
> dig @SERVER DOMAIN_NAME TYPE	# To select the custom DNS server

> dig @1.1.1.1 domain.com MX


4. DNSDUMPSTER :
	DNS lookup tools, such as nslookup and dig, cannot find subdomains on their own.
	DNSDUMPSTER can find subdomains & other info for given DOMAIN_NAME.

URL: https://dnsdumpster.com/


5. DNSENUM :
	A command line tool that can enumerate DNS Servers to find subdomains and other important info
> dnsenum DOMAIN_NAME


6. SHODAN.IO
	Shodan.io tries to connect to every device reachable online to build a search engine of connected “things” in contrast with a search 
	engine for web pages. Once it gets a response, it collects all the information related to the service and saves it in the database to 
	make it searchable.
	Can give information about the client’s network

-> ACTIVE RECON

Involves direct connections made to the target machine. 
Any such attempt might leave information in the logs showing the client IP address, time of the connection, and duration of the connection, among 
other things.

1. WEB BROWSER :
	Inspect the Web application using Developer tools available in your Web Browser

Add-ons for Firefox and Chrome that can help in penetration testing
	a. FoxyProxy: Allows to quickly change the proxy server you are using to access the target website.
		      Convenient extension when using Burp Suite or if you need to switch proxy servers regularly.
	b. User-Agent Switcher and Manager: Gives the ability to pretend to be accessing the webpage from a different operating system or different 
		      web browser.
		      You can pretend to be browsing a site using an iPhone when in fact, you are accessing it from Mozilla Firefox. 
	c. Wappalyzer: provides insights about the technologies used on the visited websites. 
		      Handy Extension primarily when you collect all this information while browsing the website like any other user. 


2. PING :
	To check whether you can reach the remote system and that the remote system can reach you back.
	Sends an ICMP Echo packet to a remote system. If the remote system is online, and the ping packet was correctly routed and not blocked by 
	any firewall, the remote system should send back an ICMP Echo Reply.
> ping HOST_NAME
> ping IP_ADDRESS
> ping -c 10 10.10.204.7    (Fot Windows > ping -m 10 10.10.204.7)	# Sends only 10 ICMP Packets


3. TRACEROUTE :
	Traces the route taken by the packets from your system to another host
	Finds the IP addresses of the routers or hops that a packet traverses as it goes from source to destination host.
> traceroute IP_ADDRESS	    (For Windows > tracert IP_ADDRESS)


4. TELNET : 
	Uses the TELNET protocol for remote administration at port 23. 
	Sends all the data, including usernames and passwords, in cleartext.
> telnet IP_ADDR PORT
	> GET / HTTP/1.1	# will request default index page at /
	> host: telnet		# To get a valid response, instead of an error, you need to input some value for the host 'host: example; and hit 
				  enter twice. 

5. NETCAT (NC) :
	Netcat supports both TCP and UDP protocols. 
> nc IP_ADDR PORT		# netcat to connect to IP_ADDR on port PORT

	Netcat to listen on a TCP port and connect to a listening port on another system.
> nc -vnlp PORT			# open a port and listen on it on receiving end
	-l	Listen mode
	-p	Specify the Port number
	-n	Numeric only; no resolution of hostnames via DNS
	-v	Verbose output (optional, yet useful to discover any bugs)
	-vv	Very Verbose (optional)
	-k	Keep listening after client disconnects
NOTES:
- The option -p should appear just before the port number you want to listen on.
- The option -n will avoid DNS lookups and warnings.
- Port numbers less than 1024 require root privileges to listen on.

> nc RECEIVER_IP PORT		# on senders side to connect to nc listener
