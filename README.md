# Reconnaissance

It is the Information-Gathering stage where you collect data about the target system

The goal of reconnaissance is to identify as many potential attack vectors as possible.

Reconnaissance generally follows seven steps:

1. Collect initial information
2. Determine the network range
3. Identify active machines
4. Find access points and open ports 
5. Fingerprint the operating system
6. Discover services on ports
7. Map the network
